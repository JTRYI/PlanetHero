        '''Instead of buying or taking a single-use plastic bag when you go shopping, simply bring your own recycle bags!

      Plastic bags are used for an average of 12 minutes
      before ending up in the thrash and then it takes
      hundreds of years to degrade in a landfill.

      Oil, which is a fossil fuel and a non-renewable
      resource, is used to make plastic bags. Because the
      production of disposable plastic shopping bags also
      releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
      reducing demand will result in less production, which
      will free up more nonrenewable resources for use in
      other ways and reduce the amount of greenhouse
      gases released into the atmosphere.'''),

You probably already use the best detergent to wash your clothes, and as such you want your drying process to be equally eco-friendly. For many households, the clothes dryer is the second-most energy-consuming appliance, right after the refrigerator. However, by simply switching from using a clothes dryer to air-drying your clothes after washing them, you could reduce your homeâ€™s carbon footprint 2,400 pounds a year. '''),
